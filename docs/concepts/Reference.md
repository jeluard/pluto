All main concepts are identified via references.

References are identified by a symbol preceded by a @. This symbol must be define a namespace that identifies the reference type.

Reference can be:

* local (e.g. `@views/id`)
* pluto defaults, depending on the platform (e.g. `@views/pluto.name`)
* third party extensions (e.g. `@views/my-extension.id` with `my-extension` being registered in .stateofus.eth)
